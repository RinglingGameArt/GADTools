import maya.cmds as cmds

#checks for selection
selection = cmds.ls(sl=True)
for selected in selection:
    
    cmds.duplicate(selected)
    #duplicates selection (obviously)
    cmds.createDisplayLayer(name ="LowRes")
    #creates a layer called "LowRes", specifically for blockouts or something like that
    cmds.setAttr('LowRes.visibility', 0)
    #hides the layer called "LowRes". This script technically only works once. But changing the name isn't a huge deal.
